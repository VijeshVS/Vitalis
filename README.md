# Vitalis

Vitalis is a **decentralized healthcare platform** developed as part of a 36-hour hackathon at **NMIT Bangalore**. The platform fosters transparency between doctors and patients, giving patients greater control over their healthcare data. 

In the current healthcare system, patients often lack ownership of their data, which is typically controlled by organizations and third parties. Vitalis addresses this problem by empowering patients with full ownership and control over their data on a **blockchain-powered decentralized platform**.

### 2. **Doctors**
